/delineate
	Reveal the surface of the AST of a given document for a language. An AST parser provides
	the full structure of a document, but for documentation use cases, only the surface
	is desired, at first, along with corresponding documentation.

	In Python's case, delineation currently reveals the surface of the structures provided by
	CPython's runtime.
